Security is increasingly becoming the responsibility of DevOps teams. Movements like DevSecOps are contributing to this change. This security checklist aims to give DevOps professionals a list of security best practices they can follow according to their company stage. DevOps teams make security decisions several times, everyday! Security is a moving target.  Doing the basics goes a long way in keeping your company and product secure. This third<sup>1</sup> edition of the DevOps Security Checklist provides actionable security best practices devops teams can use to harden their security.  This list is far from exhaustive, incomplete by nature since the security you need depends on your company, product, and assets.

### üöÄ Your Culture
<details><summary>Have an incident response plan and mechanism to communicate post-mortems <button class=stage>now</button> </summary>

It is not a question of "if" but "when". Evaluate your risks, prepare a proper action plan in case of a breach and communicate properly after the fact.

<details><summary> Stay on top of best practices
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

DevOps is an ever-changing landscape. Ensure that you stay up to date in terms of new technologies, vulnerabilities or best practices.

</details><details><summary>Understand the risk
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

The cost of breaches is drastically increasing and security should be taken seriously inside an organization. DevOps engineers should play an important role in advocating for better security practices

</details><details><summary>Gamify security and train employees on a regular basis
 <button class=stage>next
</button></summary>

Humans are the weakest links in the security chain. DevOps contribute to the security awareness of all the employees in a company. By explaining how an attacker could infiltrate your company, you will increase the awareness and thus minimize the chance of a hack. Don‚Äôt forget fishing and spear-fishing attacks.

### üíª Your Code
<details><summary>Don't implement your own crypto <button class=stage>now</button></summary>

The problem with cryptography is, that you don‚Äôt know you are wrong until you are hacked. So don‚Äôt do your own crypto. Use standards instead.

</details>

<details><summary>Ensure you are using security headers
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Modern browsers support a set of headers dedicated to block certain types of attacks. Make sure you properly implemented all security headers. Don‚Äôt forget about the CSP.

[https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html](https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html)

</details><details><summary>Keep your dependencies up to date
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Third-party libraries can put your application at risk. Make sure you track your vulnerable packages and update them regularly.

</details><details><summary>Run Security tests on your code
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is an easy and fast way to find security vulnerabilities in your code. You can enforce SAST security checks in your CI, but be aware of the high number of false positives that can frustrate developers.

</details><details><summary>Integrate security scanners in your CI pipeline
 <button class=stage>next
</button></summary>

Integrate a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool in your CI, but just like SAST be aware of the high number of false positives.

</details><details><summary>Go hack yourself
 <button class=stage>later
</button></summary>

If your company doesn‚Äôt have yet a structured security team, help create a multidisciplinary Red Team to stress your application and infrastructure. Providing an easy environment for the Red Team to attack the application should be part of the scope of DevOps.

</details><details><summary>Protect your CI/CD tools like your product
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Your continuous deployment pipeline is the backbone of your IT. Security should be checked at each step. Your CI builds should fail if you detect a security vulnerability. Store your CI configuration for traceability and audit.

### üèó Your Infrastructure
<details><summary>Backup, test your backups, then backup again <button class=stage>now</button></summary>

Backup all your critical assets. Ensure that you attempt to restore your backups frequently so you can guarantee that they‚Äôre working as intended. S3 is a very cheap and effective way to backup your assets. Instrument monitoring to ensure backups and restoration verification are working as intended. Research whether offsite and encrypted backups make sense for your product, infrastructure, and regulatory concerns (PII and user data retention).

</details><details><summary>Control access on your cloud providers
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

The best way to protect your services (database, file storage) is to not use passwords at all. Use the built-in Identity and Access Management (IAM) functions to securely control access to your ressources.

</details><details><summary>Log all the things
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Infrastructure logs and application logs are your most precious allies for investigating a data breach. Make sure your logs are stored somewhere safe and central. Also make sure you whitelist- or blacklist-specific incoming data to avoid storing personally identifiable information (PII) data.

</details><details><summary>Upgrade your servers regularly
 <button class=stage>now
</button></summary>

Server packages and libraries are often updated when security vulnerabilities are found. You should update them as soon as a security vulnerability is found.

</details><details><summary>Store encrypted passwords in your configuration management
 <button class=stage>next
</button></summary>

Storing passwords (like databases ones) can be done on a dedicated database with restricted access. An other solution is to store them encrypted in your Source Code Management (SCM) system. That way, you just need the master key to decrypt them.

When you need to store cryptographic secrets (other than database password, TLS certificate, ‚Ä¶) and perform encryption with them, you should use dedicated tools. This way the cryptographic secret never leaves the tool and you get auditing features.

### ü©∫  Monitoring
<details><summary>Audit your infrastructure on a regular basis <button class=stage>now</button></summary>

With cloud providers, it‚Äôs easy to start instances and forget about them. You will need to create and maintain a list of your assets (servers, network devices, services exposed etc‚Ä¶), and review it regularly to determine if you still need them, keep them up to date, and ensure that they benefit from your latest deployments.
