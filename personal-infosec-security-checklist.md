Doing the basics goes a long way in keeping your personal accounts secure. This first<sup>1</sup> edition of the Personal Infosec & Security Checklist provides actionable security best practices anyone can use to harden their security posture. This list is far from exhaustive, incomplete by nature since the security you need depends on your risks and threats.

### ‚öôÔ∏è  Improve account settings beyond defaults

<details><summary>For your high value accounts, turn on the highest vendor provided security settings.</summary>

For example, if you use Google, turn on ‚ÄúAdvanced Protection‚Äù which mandates the use of hardware MFA keys only among a slew of other security sensitive settings.

</details>

<details><summary>Use MFA/2FA <b><i>everywhere</i></b> possible. </summary>
Prefer to use a hardware device over an authenticator app. Hardware devices are now supported across a wide variety of services such as Dropbox, GitLab, Epic Games, Coinbase, domain registrars, cloud providers and so on. Only use a reputable authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Authy. If possible, do not use SMS as an account recovery or for MFA/2FA (see SIM takeover precautions below.) Be sure to enable MFA/2FA everywhere ‚Äî not just some limited set of accounts or services, this helps prevent lateral account takeovers that might not be immediately obvious. Use multiple devices or methods as a backup in case the primary device is lost or destroyed. Safely keep generated backup codes.

</details>

<details><summary>Turn off SMS/phone call account recovery and 2FA/MFA if possible. </summary>

Many services require a phone # when signing up which then gets used as an account recovery mechanism. Given how prevalent SIM takeover attacks continue to persist, many services now offer the ability to disable using phone/SMS as an account recovery channel. Be sure to keep recovery codes and linked accounts used for recovery secure as well.

</details>

<details><summary>Improve your password hygiene.</summary>

* Use a password manager.
  * https://www.passwordstore.org/
  * https://keepass.info/
  * https://1password.com/
* Never reuse passwords.
  * See above ‚Äî use a password manager.
* Prefer password length over complexity. When using long passwords (e.g. 32+ characters), double check the password continues to work. Sites will silently truncate input fields, have different restrictions on the password change input fields vs the login fields, etc. After rotating passwords, logout and log back in to ensure the password you intended to set is actually set.
  * https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/
* Assume all of your old passwords are out there in plain text. They are linked to your email and collated across numerous services. Also assume in many cases,  for the same service, if you‚Äôve rotated passwords all of the previous passwords are also out there in plain text.

</details>

<details><summary>Treat account security recovery questions such as ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite ice-cream?‚Äù as passwords. </summary>

Generate and save responses in your password manager.

</details>

<details><summary>Periodically review and purge unused ‚Äúconnected apps‚Äù. </summary>

Review permissions external apps have to your email, calendar, contacts, etc. Similarly, review permissions and apps you have connected to side-projects, code repos, CI systems, domains, etc.

</details>

<details><summary>Periodically review and purge unused email filters.</summary>

Remove old (or surreptitious) filters and rules that might be automatically hiding or forwarding emails to other accounts. </summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Prefer to not login to any of your accounts using someone else‚Äôs computer, phone, or device.  </summary>

Change your password from a trusted computer afterward if you login using an untrusted device. Be sure to logout and invalidate all logged in sessions.

</details>

<details><summary>If you use a custom domain for your email, ensure the registrar account is secured with MFA. </summary>

Ensure the billing has a backup credit card to prevent interrupting payment remittance. If the DNS/NS settings point to another provider, ensure that that provider is also secured with MFA. Ensure that billing is uninterrupted there as well. Ensure that privacy settings are enabled on the domain so as to not reveal any information that could be used to socially engineer a transfer. Ensure that domain transfer locks are turned on. Ensure that MX records are not duplicating mail elsewhere.

</details>

<details><summary>Be careful with email auto-replies or vacation auto-responders.  </summary>

Don‚Äôt inadvertently leak sensitive information to anyone that emails you.

</details>

### üåê Web Browsing
<details><summary>Familiarize yourself with modern phishing, scams, and other social engineering attacks.  </summary>

Stay vigilant and skeptical of all emails, phone calls, letters, and other ways to part you from your data and credentials.

https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/phishing/
</details>

<details><summary>Make sure you‚Äôre on the site you‚Äôre intending to be on.</summary>
Don‚Äôt get tricked into sending credentials to the wrong site. Use bookmarks to save known-good URLs and only use those when visiting the sites. Don't click through suspicious text messages, emails, or other alerts.
</details>

<details><summary>Don‚Äôt run commands in the terminal or browser console that you don‚Äôt fully understand.  </summary>

Commands that someone else is telling you to run at the terminal or console can substantially erode your account and device security.

</details>

<details><summary>Remove unnecessary or unused browser extensions and addons.  </summary>

There is a long and active history of extensions being sold to new owners whose updates might include things you did not initially sign up for.

</details>

<details><summary>Don‚Äôt install software from non-trusted sources.  </summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Be aware of when screen sharing, video call, or screen recording not to reveal passwords, keys, MFA QR codes, etc.  </summary>

Don't inadvertantly reveal your password a character at a time. Modern mobile OSs will turn off the trailing show-character when typing a password if screen recording is turned on, but stay vigilant. If you need to log in to an account while sharing your screen, turn the video feed off if you think a secret or credential might be shown. Be equally alert if an MFA QR code is on the screen.
